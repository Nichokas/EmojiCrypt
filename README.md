## How it works
EmojiCrypt uses a simple algorithm to convert each letter and symbol of your message into a corresponding emoji, according to a numerical key that you choose. For example, if your key is 3, the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù becomes the emoji üòÅ, the letter ‚Äúb‚Äù becomes the emoji ü§£, and so on. To decrypt the message, you just have to do the reverse process, using the same key.
